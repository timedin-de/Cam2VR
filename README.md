# Cam2VR
Simple web app, that uses the main-camera and projects it two times, so it can be used by Phone-VR-Googles.

Proof of concept, because:
- Only 2d support (add for phones with multiple cameras?
- only squares, some googles need morphed images
- setting for size, color, framerate, delay (for experiments in VR)
